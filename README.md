# GetCleanDataCourseProject:
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project repo JHBPSH date created 51224

## PURPOSE:
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 

## CONTENTS OF THIS REPO:
    1. README.md
    2. CodeBook.md
    3. *Submitted for student peer evlauation;* a link to my GitHub repository containing the run_analysis.R file that preforms the required analysis
    4. An independent tidy data set called tidy.txt containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

### DELIVERABLES DESCRIPTION:

1. Download and open the assignment zip file and save to local dir 
2. Identify and load the required R packaqes needed to manipulate and analyze the given data files
3. Unzipped and read the files, next combine them into a singular train and a singular test data sets
4. Merge the combined train and the test data sets into a single complete data set
5. Extract just the mean and standard deviation data for each measurement
6. Apply appropriate lables to describe the data set activities 
7. Apply appropriate lables to describe the data set variable names  
8. With the results from steps 1-7, creates a second, independent tidy data set called 'tidy.txt' with the average of each mean and standard deviation for each activity and each subject.
9. Submit a link to a Github repository with
    a) A TIDY data set described in step 8 above
    a) A script for performing the above data manipulation and analysis called 'run_analysis.R'
    b) A code book called 'CodeBook.md' describing the; variables, data, and transformations or work performed to clean and create the TIDY data set 
    c) A README.md file in the repo explaining how the run_analyis.R script works  

=============================================
## HOW THE PROJECT WILL BE EVALUATED:

### DEMONSTRATED DELIVERABLE:
    SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
    Please upload the tidy data set created in step 5 of the instructions. Please upload your data set as a txt file created     with write.table() using row.name=FALSE (do not cut and paste a dataset directly into the text box, as this may cause        errors saving your submission).
=============================================
### EVALUATION CRITERIA 1: 
    Has the student submitted a tidy data set?
    Either a wide or a long form of the data is acceptable if it meets the tidy data principles of week 1 (Each variable you     measure should be in one column, Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row)
      
### EVALUATION CRITERIA 2A:
    Did the student submit a Github repo with the required scripts?
### EVALUATION CRITERIA 2B:
    Was code book submitted to GitHub that modifies and updates the codebooks available to you with the data to indicate all     the variables and summaries you calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information?
### EVALUATION CRITERIA 2C:
    I was able to follow the README in the directory that explained what the analysis files did.

### EVALUATION CRITERIA 3:
    As far as you can determine, does it appear that the work submitted for this project is the work of the student who          submitted it?
